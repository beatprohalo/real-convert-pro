```python
# Vocal frequency ranges
vocal_range = (85, 8000)  # Hz

# Bass frequency ranges  
bass_range = (20, 250)    # Hz

# Drum transient detection
onset_frames = librosa.onset.onset_detect(y=audio, sr=sr)
```

### Stereo Processing

Advanced stereo field manipulation:

```python
# Mid-side processing for vocals
mid = (left + right) / 2    # Vocals often in center
side = (left - right) / 2   # Instruments often panned

# Component isolation
vocal_component = mid_channel_processing(mid)
drum_component = side_channel_processing(side)
```

### Adaptive Processing

Quality-dependent algorithm selection:

```python
processing_params = {
    'fast': {'n_fft': 2048, 'hop_length': 512},
    'balanced': {'n_fft': 4096, 'hop_length': 1024},
    'high': {'n_fft': 8192, 'hop_length': 2048},
    'ultra': {'n_fft': 16384, 'hop_length': 4096}
}

## üéØ Best Practices

### Method Selection Guidelines

1. **Basic**: Use for quick previews or when processing speed is critical
2. **Advanced**: Best overall balance of quality and speed (recommended)
3. **Spectral**: Best for frequency-rich content, classical music

5. **AI**: For future AI model integration

### Quality Setting Guidelines

1. **Fast**: Demo purposes, real-time preview
2. **Balanced**: Most production work, good quality/speed balance
3. **High**: Professional mastering, archival work
4. **Ultra**: Maximum quality for critical applications

### Stem Selection Tips

- Start with vocals, drums, bass, other for most music
- Add piano for piano-heavy tracks
- Use "other" for remaining instrumental content
- Fewer stems = better individual quality

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- librosa (core audio processing)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- scipy (signal processing, optional but recommended)
- scikit-learn (NMF support, optional)
